# TUMBLESAC

Rewriting Tumblestone (http://www.tumblestonegame.com/) to play it online with my friends

## Installation 
At repo root level :
```console
pip install -e .
```

You can then run the commands `tumblesac` and `tumblesac-server` anywhere you want

## Online configuration

Copy the file `config/online_default.cfg` into a new file `config/online.cfg`.

Edit the content of `config/online.cfg` with your player name and the ip/port of the server you want to connect to.
